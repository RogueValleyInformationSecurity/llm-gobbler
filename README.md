# Folder to Text

A command-line utility that combines multiple files into a single text document with clear file separators. This tool is useful for creating compilations of code or text files for documentation, analysis, or sharing.

## Features

- Combine multiple files into a single text document
- Filter files by file extension
- Add clear file separators with filenames
- Handle binary files with safe character replacement
- Clean up excessive newlines in the output
- Timestamp output files for version tracking

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- GCC or compatible C compiler
- Make (optional, for using the provided Makefile)

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository or download the source files
2. Build using make:
```bash
make
```

Or compile manually:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o folder_to_text folder_to_text.c
```

## Usage

```
./folder_to_text [options] [files...]
```

### Options

- `-o PATH` - Output directory path (required)
- `-n NAME` - Output filename without extension (required)
- `-t TYPES` - File types to include, comma separated (e.g., `.c,.h,.txt`)
- `-a` - Include all files (disable filtering by file type)
- `-r` - Recursively process directories
- `-name PATTERN` - Filter files by name pattern using glob syntax (e.g., `*.c`)
- `-h` - Show help message

### Examples

Combine C source files and headers into a single document:
```bash
./folder_to_text -o ./output -n project_source -t .c,.h src/main.c include/header.h src/utils.c
```

Combine all files from a project regardless of type:
```bash
./folder_to_text -o ./output -n project_all -a src/* include/* docs/*
```

Recursively find and combine all C files in a project:
```bash
./folder_to_text -o ./output -n project_c_files -name "*.c" -r src/ lib/
```

Recursively find and combine all header files:
```bash
./folder_to_text -o ./output -n project_headers -name "*.h" -r .
```

Combine specific file types recursively:
```bash
./folder_to_text -o ./output -n project_docs -t .md,.txt -r docs/
```

## Output Format

The output file will be named according to the pattern `NAME_TIMESTAMP.txt`, where:
- `NAME` is the value provided with the `-n` option
- `TIMESTAMP` is the current date and time in format `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`

Each file in the output will be formatted as:

```
'''--- filename.ext ---
[file content]
'''
```

## File Type Filtering

By default, the program filters files based on their extensions. Only files with extensions matching those provided with the `-t` option will be included.

To disable filtering and include all files, use the `-a` option.

## Error Handling

- The program will report errors when files cannot be read
- Non-UTF-8 characters in files will be replaced with the Unicode replacement character (ï¿½)
- Appropriate error messages will be displayed if required parameters are missing
