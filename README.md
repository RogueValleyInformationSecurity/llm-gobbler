# LLM Globber

A command-line utility that combines multiple files into a single text document with clear file separators. This tool is specifically designed for preparing source code to be pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google Gemini 2.0 Thinking, allowing the LLM to analyze your entire codebase within its context window.

## Features

- Combine multiple files into a single text document for LLM analysis
- Filter files by file extension to focus on relevant code
- Add clear file separators with filenames for better LLM understanding
- Handle binary files with safe character replacement
- Clean up excessive newlines to optimize token usage
- Timestamp output files for version tracking

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- GCC or compatible C compiler
- Make (optional, for using the provided Makefile)

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository or download the source files
2. Build using make:
```bash
make
```

Or compile manually:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o llm_globber llm_globber.c
```

## Usage

```
./llm_globber [options] [files...]
```

### Options

- `-o PATH` - Output directory path (required)
- `-n NAME` - Output filename without extension (required)
- `-t TYPES` - File types to include, comma separated (e.g., `.c,.h,.txt`)
- `-a` - Include all files (disable filtering by file type)
- `-r` - Recursively process directories
- `-name PATTERN` - Filter files by name pattern using glob syntax (e.g., `*.c`)
- `-h` - Show help message

### Examples

Combine C source files and headers into a single document for LLM analysis:
```bash
./llm_globber -o ./output -n project_source -t .c,.h src/main.c include/header.h src/utils.c
```

Combine all files from a project regardless of type:
```bash
./llm_globber -o ./output -n project_all -a src/* include/* docs/*
```

Recursively find and combine all C files in a project:
```bash
./llm_globber -o ./output -n project_c_files -name "*.c" -r src/ lib/
```

Recursively find and combine all header files:
```bash
./llm_globber -o ./output -n project_headers -name "*.h" -r .
```

Combine specific file types recursively:
```bash
./llm_globber -o ./output -n project_docs -t .md,.txt -r docs/
```

Prepare your entire codebase for LLM analysis:
```bash
./llm_globber -o ./output -n for_llm -t .py,.js,.html,.css,.md -r .
```

## Output Format

The output file will be named according to the pattern `NAME_TIMESTAMP.txt`, where:
- `NAME` is the value provided with the `-n` option
- `TIMESTAMP` is the current date and time in format `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`

Each file in the output will be formatted as:

```
'''--- filename.ext ---
[file content]
'''
```

## File Type Filtering

By default, the program filters files based on their extensions. Only files with extensions matching those provided with the `-t` option will be included.

To disable filtering and include all files, use the `-a` option.

## Error Handling

- The program will report errors when files cannot be read
- Non-UTF-8 characters in files will be replaced with the Unicode replacement character (ï¿½)
- Appropriate error messages will be displayed if required parameters are missing
